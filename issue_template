### Module Overview:
Provide a high-level description of what the module is supposed to do and why it's needed.
For example: "This module is responsible for managing user authentication, including login, registration, and password management."

### Dependencies:
List the dependencies this module relies on. Include both external libraries or frameworks and other internal modules.
- Example: "This module will rely on the `DatabaseModule` for storing user credentials."
- Example: "It will also depend on the `EmailService` module to send verification emails."

### Functionalities:
Describe the key features that the module will provide.
- Example: "Allow users to log in with their email and password."
- Example: "Provide a secure password reset flow."
- Example: "Handle two-factor authentication."

### Approach / Implementation Plan:
Outline the steps or strategy you will follow to implement the module. This can be broken down into smaller tasks or phases.
1. **Step 1**: "Define the user model and database schema."
2. **Step 2**: "Set up the login and registration API endpoints."
3. **Step 3**: "Integrate with the `EmailService` for email verification."
4. **Step 4**: "Write unit tests for authentication methods."
5. **Step 5**: "Perform integration testing with the front-end."

### Expected Outcome:
Describe what the module will accomplish once itâ€™s implemented and tested. You can also mention any success criteria.
- Example: "The user should be able to register, log in, and reset their password securely."

### Additional Notes:
Any other details or considerations that may be important. For example, potential challenges, integration concerns, or areas that might require further discussion.
